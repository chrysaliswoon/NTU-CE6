- Choose a specific use case (e.g. web application development, big data processing, machine learning) and determine which type of service (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.

- Create a sample project that demonstrates the use of one of the services (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) and compare it with the other services.

- Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different services, an analysis of the chosen use case, and any recommendations for improvement.
