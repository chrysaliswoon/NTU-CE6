# Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

- Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
- Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
- Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
- Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.
- Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Be sure to consider the most recent advancements in each model.

## Introduction

Citibank, as one of the largest financial institutions in the world, relies heavily on robust and secure computing infrastructures to handle vast amounts of data and transactions. 

With the evolving landscape of technology, Citibank faces the decision of choosing between traditional computing, cloud computing, and hybrid computing models. This report aims to compare and contrast these models, focusing on aspects such as cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.

## Computing Models Overview

### Traditional Computing (On-Premises)

**Description:** Traditional computing involves maintaining all hardware and software on-site, managed directly by the institution.

**Benefits:**
- Complete control over hardware and data
- Customizable infrastructure
- Enhanced security through physical and network isolation

**Limitations:**
- High initial capital expenditure
- Scalability challenges
- Higher ongoing maintenance and operational costs

### Cloud Computing

**Description:** Cloud computing leverages services provided by third-party cloud vendors, offering resources such as storage, computing power, and applications over the internet.

**Benefits:**
- Lower initial costs with pay-as-you-go models
- High scalability and flexibility
- Reduced need for physical infrastructure and maintenance

**Limitations:**
- Security concerns over data breaches and compliance
- Potential downtime and dependency on internet connectivity
- Limited control over infrastructure

### Hybrid Computing

**Description:** Hybrid computing combines traditional on-premises infrastructure with cloud services, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

**Benefits:**
- Balanced approach leveraging the best of both worlds
- Enhanced scalability with on-demand cloud resources
- Improved disaster recovery and backup options

**Limitations:**
- Increased complexity in management and integration
- Potential security vulnerabilities during data transfer
- Higher costs than pure cloud solutions

## Comparative Analysis

### Financial Cost
**Traditional Computing:**

- High upfront capital investment for hardware and software.
- Ongoing costs for maintenance, upgrades, and personnel.

**Cloud Computing:**

- Low initial cost with subscription-based pricing.
- Costs can escalate with high usage but are predictable and scalable.

**Hybrid Computing:**

- Moderate initial costs, combining investments in on-premises infrastructure and cloud services.
- Potentially higher total cost due to dual management requirements.

### Level of Scalability

**Traditional Computing:**
- Limited by physical hardware capacity.
- Scaling up requires significant investment and time.

**Cloud Computing:**
- Highly scalable with near-instant resource allocation.
- Allows for dynamic scaling based on demand.

**Hybrid Computing:**
- Flexible scalability, combining on-premises resources with cloud bursts for high demand.
- Efficient for handling varying workloads.

### Level of Security

**Traditional Computing:**

- High security due to isolated systems and dedicated security measures.
- Risks include physical breaches and internal threats.

**Cloud Computing:**

- Advanced security measures by cloud providers, but shared responsibility.
- Concerns over data privacy, compliance, and potential for external breaches.

**Hybrid Computing:**

- Balanced security with critical data on-premises and less sensitive data in the cloud.
- Complexity in ensuring seamless security across both environments.

### Flexibility
**Traditional Computing:**
- Less flexible due to fixed infrastructure and long upgrade cycles.
- Customizable but at a high cost and effort.

**Cloud Computing:**
- Highly flexible with rapid deployment of resources and services.
- Easier to adopt new technologies and scale operations.

**Hybrid Computing:**
- Flexible and adaptable to various needs.
- Allows gradual transition to the cloud while retaining critical on-premises systems.

## Use Case Analysis for Citibank

Given Citibank's global operations and the critical nature of its services, a hybrid computing model appears to be the most advantageous. 

This model offers a balanced approach, providing the security and control of traditional computing for sensitive data and applications, while leveraging the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing for customer-facing applications and data analytics.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Financial institutions are subject to stringent regulatory requirements. A hybrid model allows Citibank to keep sensitive customer data and critical applications on-premises, ensuring compliance while using the cloud for less sensitive workloads.

- **Disaster Recovery:** Hybrid computing offers robust disaster recovery solutions, combining on-premises backups with cloud-based redundancy.

- **Cost Efficiency:** While potentially higher in management costs, the hybrid model enables Citibank to optimize expenditure by scaling cloud resources according to demand, reducing the need for over-provisioning.

- **Innovation and Agility:** The hybrid model supports innovation by enabling quick deployment of new services and technologies in the cloud, while maintaining core banking operations securely on-premises.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while traditional computing provides control and security, it lacks the scalability and flexibility required for modern financial operations. 

Cloud computing offers excellent scalability and cost benefits but comes with potential security and compliance challenges. 

Hybrid computing emerges as the optimal solution for Citibank, combining the strengths of both models to meet the complex demands of a global financial institution. 

This approach allows Citibank to maintain control over critical operations while leveraging the cloud for innovation and agility, ensuring a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving financial sector.
