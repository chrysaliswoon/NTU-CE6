# Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

- Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
- Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
- Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
- Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.
- Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Be sure to consider the most recent advancements in each model.
