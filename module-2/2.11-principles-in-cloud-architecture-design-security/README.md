# What is Cloud Architecture Design - Security

**Cloud Architecture Design - Security** refers to the strategic framework and best practices implemented to protect cloud environments, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. It involves designing cloud infrastructure with a focus on security from the ground up, incorporating measures like identity and access management (IAM), encryption, network security, and compliance with regulatory standards.

**Key components include:**

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Ensures that only authorized users and services have access to resources.
- **Encryption**: Protects data at rest and in transit from unauthorized access.
- **Network Security**: Utilizes firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection/prevention systems to safeguard data flow.
- **Compliance and Governance**: Adheres to industry standards and legal requirements.
- **Monitoring and Incident Response**: Continuously monitors for threats and has plans in place to respond to security incidents.

This holistic approach helps mitigate risks, ensuring the cloud infrastructure is resilient against various cyber threats.
