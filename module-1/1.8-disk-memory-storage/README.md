# Brief
This assignment will be a research assignment.

Choose one topic and discuss with your group the following:

- Give the advantages and disadvantages of magnetic storage devices
- What is SSD? And why is it faster than HDD?
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using optical media
- Discuss why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised (Ex. 2TB is 1.81TB in Windows)
- What are some Cloud storage options that we can use? What are the pros and cons of storing data in the Cloud?

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Magnetic Storage Devices

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| High storage capacity | Susceptible to physical damage |
| Relatively low cost per GB | Slower access times compared to SSDs |
| Well-established technology | Prone to data corruption over time |
| Suitable for long-term archival | Mechanical components can fail |
| Can retain data without power | Limited lifespan compared to SSDs |
| Compatibility with older systems | Consumes more power than SSDs |
| Easy to implement redundancy |

# What is SSD? And why is it faster than HDD?

SSD (Solid State Drive) is a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory. 

Unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), which use spinning disks and moving read/write heads to access data, SSDs have no moving parts. Instead, they store data in memory chips, allowing for much faster access times and data transfer rates.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of using Optical Media

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| High storage capacity | Vulnerable to scratches and damage |
| Portability | Slower read/write speeds compared to some other storage mediums |
| Compatibility with a wide range of devices | Becoming less common as newer technologies emerge |
| Can be used for archival purposes | Not suitable for frequent data access or rapid data transfer |
| Offers read-only protection for sensitive data | Limited shelf life compared to some other storage mediums |

# Discuss why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised

There are a few reasons why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised and a few are as follows:

1. **Partitioning and Formatting**: Drives need to be partitioned and formatted before they can be used. During this process, a portion of the drive space is allocated for the file system structures, reducing the available space.

2. **Reserved Space**: Some space on the drive may be reserved for system use, such as for system recovery or over-provisioning on SSDs.

3. **Storage Calculation**: The discrepancy results from the different ways flash memory and hard drive manufacturers calculate megabyte. Hard drive manufacturers calculate a megabyte (or 1,000x1,000 bytes) as 1,000KBs, whereas the binary calculation is 1,024KBs.

# Cloud Storage Options
