# Brief
This assignment will be a research assignment.

Choose one topic and discuss with your group the following:

- Give the advantages and disadvantages of magnetic storage devices
- What is SSD? And why is it faster than HDD?
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using optical media
- Discuss why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised (Ex. 2TB is 1.81TB in Windows)
- What are some Cloud storage options that we can use? What are the pros and cons of storing data in the Cloud?

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Magnetic Storage Devices

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| High storage capacity | Susceptible to physical damage |
| Relatively low cost per GB | Slower access times compared to SSDs |
| Well-established technology | Prone to data corruption over time |
| Suitable for long-term archival | Mechanical components can fail |
| Can retain data without power | Limited lifespan compared to SSDs |
| Compatibility with older systems | Consumes more power than SSDs |
| Easy to implement redundancy |

# What is SSD? And why is it faster than HDD?

SSD (Solid State Drive) is a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory. 

Unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), which use spinning disks and moving read/write heads to access data, SSDs have no moving parts. Instead, they store data in memory chips, allowing for much faster access times and data transfer rates.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of using Optical Media

# Discuss why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised
