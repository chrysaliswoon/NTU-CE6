# Introduction
Security consists of all the technologies and practices that keep computer systems and electronic data safe. Here are a few examples:

- **Network security** - Protects computer networks like home Wi-Fi or a business’s network from threats
- **Application security** - Ensures programs and apps repel hackers and keep users’ data private
- **Cloud security** - Focuses on the cloud, where users and businesses store data and run apps online using remote data centers
- **Information security** - Focuses on keeping sensitive data safe and private
- **Endpoint security** - Secures devices like computers, phones or Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets to ensure they don’t become a way to get into other devices or data on a network.- 

### Encoding, Hashing & Encryption
1. Encoding

    Encoding data is a process involving changing data into a new format using a scheme. Encoding is a reversible process; meaning that data can be encoded to a new format and decoded to its original format.

    An example of encoding is: Base64

2. Hashing

    Hashing involves computing a fixed-length mathematical summary of data, hence, the input data can be any size.

    An example of a hash function is: SHA512

3. Encryption

    Encryption is the process of securely encoding data in such a way that only authorized users with a key or password can decrypt the data to reveal the original. There are two basic types of encryption; symmetric key and public key. In symmetric key, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, like a password. In public key encryption, one key is use to encrypt data and a different key is used to decrypt the data.

    An example of encryption is: AES 256.

- 2018 - A Cyber Attack on Marriott Hotels

You may pick another topic that is related to security and present it as a group. Take no more than 10 minutes for the presentation.

# 2010 - WeWork Network Vulnerabilities

![WeWork Office](https://ctfassets.imgix.net/vh7r69kgcki3/74VrT45gW1HN1sjP6Fo6Zz/32b45503203d30cb602ec5662b7aa702/Web_150DPI-DSCF0808.jpg?auto=format%20compress&fit=crop&q=50&w=1000&h=563)

## Brief Background (What & How it happened)
The documentation of this WiFi security breach began in mid-2015, when MMI Broadcasting moved into a workspace in one of WeWork’s Manhattan locations. 

Founder Teemu Airamo immediately scanned the WiFi network provided to the location’s 200 tenants to make sure it was secure. What he found was the documents of his neighbors, including financial records, sitting open for anyone to grab.

The network that WeWork has been running since it was founded in 2010 appears to have never had these fundamental WiFi security elements in place. 

The co-working company operates in the world’s biggest cities, often based in the financial districts and business centers. Its clients tend to include companies handling all sorts of sensitive financial and business information. It appears that all of that information has been sitting open to anyone with the local WeWork network password for some years now.

## Effect
Thousands of sensitive data which goes through the co-working space shared network could be pulled and seen, including user's banking information, company data, passports, etc.

Two loan companies had sensitive documents leaked on WeWork's Wi-Fi network, despite having their own offices in California and New York.

Hanover Search Group, a UK-based executive recruitment company, has a branch in New York based in a WeWork facility and also had documents like curricula vitae exposed on the building's network. 

## Resolution & Prevention
It doesn't seem like WeWork ever did resolve this issue. They do offer offers security as an additional cost. This is on top of the $720 monthly fee for a one-person office in New York.

**Suggested Resolution & Prevention would be:**

- Set up a segregated network, one for public use and another one for private company/tenant's use. A bonus would be to set up your own firewall and switches to control your system more securely.
- Encrypt your traffic using Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
- Encrypt your computer using professional software which have an option built-in to encrypt your hard drive (FileVault on Macs & BitLocker on Windows)
- Back-up data using external hard drives and cloud
