# Brief
Migration to cloud is not a trivial work. It involves detailed analysis in migrating large set of data, complex softwares, and sophisticated IT processes from one place to another. In this assignment, we were grouped in 3 to research on the given challenges and provide the best solutions they could garner.

# Research

| Challenge #  | Describe the challenge with assumptions | Proposed Solution(s) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Challenge 1** - Compatibility Issue  | **Scenario:** Your superior wants to leverage on serverless technology as it eliminates operational overheads but the software is not serverless ready.  | Before implementing anything, the first step would be to evaluate the existing software architecture to identify any limitation or dependencies that may prevent it from being deployed or implemented in a serverless environment. Afterwards, identify components within the software which are stateless and can be easily decoupled from the existing infrastructure as stateless components can be migrated to a serverless architecture. Instead of attempting a full-scale migration at once, it would be better to do it in phases where the company can incrementally migrate various components of the software to a serverless architecture. |
| **Challenge 2** - Vendor Lock-in  | **Scenario:** You have picked Cloud X as the destination of your migration only to find out that you'll better with Cloud Y as your technology scale.  | Content Cell |
| **Challenge 3** - Processes & Policies  | **Scenario:** Locally (in data center) configured security policies is not identical to the policies architecture in the Cloud. The deployment process of the current IT Operations Team may not fit well with the Cloud's.  | Content Cell |

# Keywords & Terminologies

- **Serverless Technology**: Also known as serverless computing. It is a cloud computing model where cloud providers manage the infrastructure required to run applications, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code. 

- **Stateless**: Refers to modules or elements within an application that do not maintain any internal state or data between invocations. 

- **Decoupled**: It refers to the degree to which components or modules within a system are independent of each other and can function without relying on the details or implementation of other components.
