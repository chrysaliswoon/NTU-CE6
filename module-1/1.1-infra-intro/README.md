# Brief
Migration to cloud is not a trivial work. It involves detailed analysis in migrating large set of data, complex softwares, and sophisticated IT processes from one place to another. In this assignment, we were grouped in 3 to research on the given challenges and provide the best solutions they could garner.

# Research

| Challenge #  | Describe the challenge with assumptions | Proposed Solution(s) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Challenge 1 - Compatibility Issue  | Scenario: Your superior wants to leverage on serverless technology as it eliminates operational overheads but the software is not serverless ready.  | Content Cell |
| Challenge 2: Vendor Lock-in  | Scenario: You have picked Cloud X as the destination of your migration only to find out that you'll better with Cloud Y as your technology scale.  | Content Cell |
| Challenge 3: Processes & Policies  | Scenario: Locally (in data center) configured security policies is not identical to the policies architecture in the Cloud. The deployment process of the current IT Operations Team may not fit well with the Cloud's.  | Content Cell |
