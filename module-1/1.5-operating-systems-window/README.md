- What is the difference between Windows 10 and 11?

Selected group may be required to share a quick presentation no longer than 10min.

# What is the difference between CMD and Powershell?

Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell are both command-line interfaces available in Windows operating systems, but they have significant differences in terms of functionality, syntax, and capabilities.

PowerShell offers a more modern and powerful environment for system administration, scripting, and automation, whereas CMD remains more basic and limited in functionality.

# What are the other features in Windows that are available to administrators?

1. **Group Policy**: Group Policy allows administrators to manage and enforce computer and user settings across an organization's network. It's a powerful tool for controlling security settings, deploying software, and configuring user preferences.

2. **PowerShell**: PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language that enables administrators to automate tasks and manage Windows systems more efficiently. It provides access to a wide range of administrative functions and can be used for tasks ranging from simple to complex automation.

3. **Remote Desktop Services (RDS)**: RDS allows users to access Windows applications and desktops remotely. Administrators can deploy and manage virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), session-based desktops, and RemoteApp programs to provide centralized access to resources.

# What is the system registry and how can it be accessed in Windows?

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system, hardware, applications, and user preferences. It serves as a central repository for storing information that Windows and installed software use to function properly.

**Accessing the Windows Registry can be done using several methods:**

1. **Registry Editor (regedit)**: The most common tool for accessing and editing the registry is the Registry Editor, also known as regedit. To open the Registry Editor, you can:
Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog, type `regedit`, and press Enter.

    Alternatively, you can search for "Registry Editor" in the Start menu or Start screen and open it from there.

2. **Command Prompt (reg command)**: You can use the `reg` command-line tool to perform registry operations from the Command Prompt. Some common commands include:
`reg query`: View registry keys and values.
`reg add`: Add new keys and values to the registry.
`reg delete`: Delete registry keys and values.
`reg import`: Import registry settings from a file.
`reg export`: Export registry settings to a file.

3. **PowerShell**: PowerShell also provides cmdlets for interacting with the registry. Some common cmdlets include:
`Get-Item`: Retrieve registry keys and values.
`New-Item`: Create new registry keys.
`Remove-Item`: Delete registry keys and values.
`Set-ItemProperty`: Set registry values.
